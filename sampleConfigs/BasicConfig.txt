# This file provides the syntax and semantics of the configuration files 
# for the pipeline simulator

# There are 6 configuration parameters. They are:
#     - numStages: The number of stages in the pipeline
#     - numWorkItems: The total number of "items" to be processed by the 
#           pipeline
#     - baseDelay: The time delay to "process" each "item" in microseconds.
#     - imbalanceFactor: The modifier to the delay for each pipeline, also in
#           in microseconds.
#     - maxPipelineCapacity: The maximum number of "items" in the pipeline.
#     - skipNoPipeline: The non pipelined example should not be run.

# The parser for the config file allows comments. Comments are signified by 
# the first character in the line being a "#", followed immediately by a space.

# The configuration parser supports you providing all the configuration 
# parameters out of order and has defaults for each configuration parameter
# should you decide to omit a configuration parameter.

# The defaults for each parameter are as follows:
#   - numStages = 4
#   - numWorkItems = 10000
#   - baseDelay = 20
#   - maxPipelineCapacity = 100
#   - imbalanceFactor = 0 0 0 0
# And the skipNoPipeline flag is not set.

# The parser will also ignore empty lines, but the parser will throw an error
# if you do not provide the parameter with correct captialization. I.e.:
# NumStages, numstages, nUmStAgEs are all incorrect and will cause an error.

# Do not worry, the parser throws sane errors, and will fail on the first error
# encountered. 

# In order to specify any configuration, just provide the name of the 
# configuration parameter, followed by a space, followed by an integer value
# for the configuration parameter value. For the imbalanceFactor specification,
# you need to space separate each value. Here is an example of a valid config:

numStages 3
numWorkItems 20000
baseDelay 15
maxPipelineCapacity 66
imbalanceFactor 2 -4 0


# If you want to skip the run without pipelining, then you can do so by simply
# adding the parameter "skipNoPipeline" to the config file.
